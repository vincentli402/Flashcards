# Flashcards

## Lab 1

### App Description
The "Flashcards" app is a simple flashcard app that provides a question and answer. The app allows the user to toggle between the question and answer with a simple interaction of the card. There are also multiple choice answers beneath the card that the user can choose. If the choice selected is correct, the card will toggle to the answer. If the choice selected is incorrect, that choice will be removed.
